How to use Will
===============

the Will compiler is implemented in Haskell and right now all its source code is in the file will.hs.
So compile it with, for example:
ghc will.hs

The Will source file is right now read by the compiler from the standard input. So if the source code is in a file called hello.will, compile it with:
./will < hello.will

The compiler will output one XML file for each context in the Will file. For example, if the source file contains:

in Firefox, Google Chrome:
command 1
command 2

in Terminal:
command 3

in Firefox:
command 4

3 files will be generated, one with the commands to be executed in the context "Firefox" and the other 2 for the contexts "Google Chrome" and "Terminal".
These files have extension ".commands text" and can be directly imported into Dragon (for Mac).


==============
Implementation
==============

The functions that implement each compiler phase are grouped together and separated by a set of comments naming each compiler phase. They are chained together in the function "compile" in the bottom of the file.
